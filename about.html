                            <p>My name is Mohamed Jaafar.</p>
                            
                            <p>I'm a product-minded backend engineer and founder building the rails for ethical finance. I write Go for almost everything backend: clean boundaries (hexagonal), event-driven messaging, secure auth, and data pipelines that tell the truth about the product.</p>
                            
                            <p>I'm currently based in London, pursuing an MSc in Financial Technology and building <strong>Fifi</strong> ‚Äî an AI-native, Shariah-aligned personal finance platform. Fifi brings accounts, compliant investing, savings goals, and Zakat/Sadaqah into one place, with screening and impact reporting built-in. The vision is bigger than an app: an ecosystem where finance is understandable, automatable, and aligned with values.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Previously, I led at Fingo Africa on Cards, Auth, and an AI microservice for personalized support. I increased scalability and reliability (99.9% uptime) while reducing production errors through proactive observability. Built microservices for payments and digital banking, plus data dashboards (100+ KPIs) used to guide growth. Designed integrations across KYC/KYB, card processors, and open-banking partners.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've shipped customs and billing microservices for enterprise workflows (RabbitMQ, Redis, Postgres), created event streams for onboarding/payments/commissions, and built analytics you can actually act on (PostHog, Metabase). I like owning the loop: architecture ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí instrumentation ‚Üí feedback ‚Üí iteration.</p>
                    
                    <p>Tech I reach for: Go, gRPC/REST, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ/Redis, Docker/Kubernetes on AWS, IaC and CI/CD, Grafana/Prometheus, and occasionally TigerBeetle for high-integrity ledgers. On the product side: clear SRS/PRDs, fast vertical slices, and metrics that map to user happiness and regulatory safety.</p>
                    
                    <p>My compass: ship useful things, keep users safe, measure honestly, and make money make sense ‚Äî especially for communities that need transparent, halal options. If you're building in open banking, payments, or responsible investing (conventional or Islamic), I'm always up for a deep technical chat or a fast prototype.</p>
