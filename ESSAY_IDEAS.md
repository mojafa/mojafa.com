# Essay ideas

Use these as prompts. Write in your voice; keep them tight and concrete, not philosophical fluff.

---

## Identity & craft (you’ve already got a thread here)

- **Why I still write Go** — What you’ve seen in other languages, why you keep choosing Go for systems. One or two war stories.
- **From trading to building** — The arc: forex at 18, getting wrecked, what you learned, how it led to Fifi. Very short, very specific.
- **What “product-minded” actually means** — Not a buzzword. A concrete example: one feature or decision where you had to think like product and eng at once.
- **Building for people who got left out** — One story of a user or a moment that made “ethical finance” real for you. No sermon, just the story.

## Systems & building

- **99.9% uptime is a product decision** — How you got there at Fingo (or elsewhere). One or two tactics: observability, failure modes, what you cut.
- **Event-driven isn’t a buzzword** — One system where events were the right call. What broke when you didn’t have them, or what got simpler when you did.
- **What I learned shipping a Rust service** — Fifi’s news scraper or anything Rust. What was hard, what was worth it, what you’d do again.
- **The first 100 users** — Fifi Terminal or any product. What you measured, what you ignored, one thing you’d do differently.

## Finance & ethics

- **Why Shariah screening isn’t “niche”** — It’s a different set of constraints. One example: a company or instrument that passes/fails and why it matters.
- **What “halal” actually means for software** — No fatwa, just: what does your product *not* do, and why? One clear example.
- **Zakat as a product problem** — Calculation, thresholds, flows. One thing that’s hard to build or explain.
- **Open banking in Africa: one integration** — Pick one bank or provider. What was easy, what was painful, what you’d tell the next builder.

---

## Learning & writing

- **What I’m wrong about** — Pick one belief (technical or product). Argue against yourself. Short.
- **Books that changed how I build** — 3–5 books, one paragraph each. What you took from them.
- **Why I write in public** — Your real reason. No humblebrag. One anecdote.
- **The essay I keep not writing** — The topic you’re avoiding and why. Meta, but honest.

---

## Tactics

- **One idea per essay.** If you can’t say it in one sentence, narrow it.
- **Start with a scene or a number.** Not “I believe that…” — start with “Last Tuesday the service went down” or “We hit 99.9% in Q3.”
- **Cut the first two paragraphs.** Often the real start is paragraph 3.
- **Ship short.** 500–800 words is enough. You can always expand later.
