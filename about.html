                            <p>My name is Mohamed Jaafar.</p>
                            
                            <p>I'm a product-minded backend engineer and founder building the rails for ethical finance. I write Go for almost everything backend: clean boundaries (hexagonal), event-driven messaging, secure auth, and data pipelines that tell the truth about the product.</p>
                            
                            <p>I'm currently based in London, pursuing an MSc in Financial Technology and building <strong>Fifi</strong> — an AI-native, Shariah-aligned personal finance platform. Fifi brings accounts, compliant investing, savings goals, and Zakat/Sadaqah into one place, with screening and impact reporting built-in. The vision is bigger than an app: an ecosystem where finance is understandable, automatable, and aligned with values.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Previously, I led at Fingo Africa on Cards, Auth, and an AI microservice for personalized support. I increased scalability and reliability (99.9% uptime) while reducing production errors through proactive observability. Built microservices for payments and digital banking, plus data dashboards (100+ KPIs) used to guide growth. Designed integrations across KYC/KYB, card processors, and open-banking partners.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've shipped customs and billing microservices for enterprise workflows (RabbitMQ, Redis, Postgres), created event streams for onboarding/payments/commissions, and built analytics you can actually act on (PostHog, Metabase). I like owning the loop: architecture → implementation → instrumentation → feedback → iteration.</p>
                    
                    <p>Tech I reach for: Go, gRPC/REST, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ/Redis, Docker/Kubernetes on AWS, IaC and CI/CD, Grafana/Prometheus, and occasionally TigerBeetle for high-integrity ledgers. On the product side: clear SRS/PRDs, fast vertical slices, and metrics that map to user happiness and regulatory safety.</p>
                    
                    <p>My compass: ship useful things, keep users safe, measure honestly, and make money make sense — especially for communities that need transparent, halal options. If you're building in open banking, payments, or responsible investing (conventional or Islamic), I'm always up for a deep technical chat or a fast prototype.</p>
